# Off-Campus Food Recommendation Model - YumRadar (Off Campus)

This repository contains the off-campus module of the YumRadar food recommendation system. It recommends the best eating places around the DTU campus based on user preferences. The system predicts suitable food outlets such as Hungry Yak/DTU Cafe, Yellow Bowl, Baozi, Rohini Market Cafes, and others.

## Overview

- Model Used: Random Forest Classifier (Best accuracy: 82%)
- Other Models Tried: Logistic Regression, XGBoost
- Techniques Applied:
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
  - SMOTE for handling class imbalance
  - Train-Test Split and performance evaluation using classification report
  - Encoded using ColumnTransformer
- Deployment Ready: Integrated with a Streamlit frontend for real-time predictions with properly mapped inputs
