On-Campus Food Recommendation Model - YumRadar (On Campus)

This repository contains the on-campus module of the **YumRadar** food recommendation system designed to suggest the best eating outlets **within the DTU campus** based on user preferences. It leverages machine learning to predict suitable food spots like *Raj Soin, Hims, Raydee, Dosa Plaza, Nescafe,* and more.

- *Model Used*: Random Forest Classifier (Best accuracy: **82%**)
- *Other Models Tried*: Logistic Regression, XGBoost
- *Techniques Applied*:
  - **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables
  - **SMOTE** for handling class imbalance
  - **Train-Test Split** and performance evaluation using `classification_report`
  - Encoded using **ColumnTransformer**
- **Deployment Ready**: Integrated with a Streamlit frontend for real-time prediction with mapped inputs

- Raj Soin  
- Hims  
- Raydee  
- Dosa Plaza

How It Works

Users provide their preferences like:

- Budget
- Food preference (Veg/Non-Veg)
- Willingness for drinks
- Travel time range

The model processes this input, encodes it, and predicts the most relevant food outlet on campus.
